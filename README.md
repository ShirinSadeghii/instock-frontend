# InStock Inventory Management System Project #

## Project Overview ##

This project involves building a full-stack React application, 'InStock,' for an Inventory Management System catering to a Fortune 500 client. The existing system lacks scalability and struggles with performance under heavy traffic. The goal is to deliver a time-sensitive, modern, and scalable solution with a React front-end communicating with a robust Express back-end.

The project follows Agile methodologies, resembling a collaborative team structure found in modern tech companies. A Jira Scrum board is set up for task management, and the team will use Git, GitHub, and Scrum methodology to facilitate a streamlined collaborative workflow.
